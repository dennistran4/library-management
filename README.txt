Project number 2 from the end of 2020 (yrkeshogskolan)

Library system with loan of Books and Movies developed in JAVA via IDE Eclipse with writing in file in byte-code format

The system is run via console and does not have any integrated graphics application, so it does not need installation for its execution.
The system can be run via the console directly (CMD) or via an IDE.

SETTINGS

The library system does not have configuration files, so the system settings are embedded in the code and with very little relevance to the user.

CHARACTERISTICS

The library system allows registration of books and movies, removal of books and films, and can be associated with a customer who borrows them. The product stock allows for only one unit of each item and the customer can borrow more than one book or film.
The system is interactive via a console where the products have the following characteristics when registering:

Books: Unique code, title, number of pages, value and publisher.
Movies: Unique code, title, duration, value and rating.

When the product is lent to a customer, it provides the telephone number and full name.

The menu is interactive with command options for registering products and also for lending to a customer.

The commands accepted by the system are:

list -> presents all registered products
checkout + product code -> lend a product to a customer
checkin + product code -> returns the product to stock after loan
register -> Register a new product (Book or movie)
deregister + article code -> remove the product from the system
info + article code -> Informs the status of the product and its description
quit -> closes the system
